# UI for City Seeker

City Seeker is a real-time multiplayer game that begins by placing you and your firends in a random location somewhere in the world.
You can walk around via a Google Street View window and when you have an idea of where you are, make a guess by placing a marker on the map.
You are awarded points based on how close your guess was to the actual location.
